<p>Hello Mike:

The main problem is that pause and stop do not work here. Desired behavior is that the show pauses or stops in place, or at least gracefully transitions to the next slide then stops. Instead the show continues. Destroying and recreating the show allows it to be stopped, but it inelegantly (and unacceptably) jumps to the first slide (and only the first slide in this case because I am demand loading the other slides).

I *really* appreciate your help/advice/guidance on this!  It is the final bit I need to resolve because otherwise, the plugin is working perfectly for my purposes.  

A VERY important demo is riding on this looking very compelling!

Terri

Please feel free to call me if it is helpful in solving this expediently!  415-686-9353.

THANK YOU!

@TerriBeausejour C2 is not currently well-suited to tackle the scenario of huge slides scrolling very slowly with pause/resume support...<br />
